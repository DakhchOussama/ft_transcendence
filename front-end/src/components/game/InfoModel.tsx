            <p className={` ${mono.className}`}>
              {`              The game is played on a rectangular court with two paddles and a
              ball. You control one paddle (either with arrow keys or the
              mouse), while the computer controls the other. The game starts
              with the ball in the center of the court. Your goal is to prevent
              the ball from getting past your paddle while trying to score by
              getting the ball past your opponent's paddle. When the ball passes
              your opponent's paddle and goes off the screen on their side, you
              earn a point. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.`}

            <h3 className={`${mono.className}`}>Tips:</h3>
            <p className={` ${mono.className}`}>
              {`            Try to predict the ball's trajectory and position your paddle
            accordingly to hit it. Don't let the ball get past your paddle, as
            that will result in your opponent scoring a point. Focus on both
            defense and offense, as you need to both prevent your opponent
            from scoring and try to score points yourself. Pong can be a
            fast-paced game, so be quick with your reactions. Enjoy playing
            Pong, and may the best player win!`}
